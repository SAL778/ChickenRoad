## Introduction
### Game Summary
Chicken Street is a silly game about making a chicken cross a busy road by tempting it with things on the other side.
### Inspiration
- **Frogger** - In Frogger you had to cross rivers and streets to get to the other side. The same aspect is being used here to provide a challenge to making the chicken cross the road.
- **Why did the chicken cross the road?** - A classic joke.
- **Crossy Road** - Crossy Road has a chicken on a grid where you jump across a road while avoiding vehicles.
### Player Experience
The player has a UI of different items they can place on the other side of the road. When placed, the chicken will move towards whatever item it currently desires, but must move through the busy road to get there.
### Platform
This game is being developed to run off a web browser.
###Development Software
- Unity
- Maya
### Genre
Puzzle, Casual, Horror (if you're a chicken).
### Target Audience	
Chicken Street has a very simple gameplay mechanic and silly premise, meaning it is well suited toward casual gaming.

## Concept
### Gameplay Overview
The player has no control over the chicken character, and instead must use the tools at their disposal to make the chicken cross to the other side.
### Theme Interpretation
“Make me Laugh” - Using the classic “Why did the chicken cross the road” joke as a base for the game, we hope to create a humorous experience for the player.
